#A simple python based utility that can delete duplicate files from any directory.
#
#including sub-directory scan is also a feature
#but md5deep utility have to be already installed.


# Import Modules

import commands
import linecache
import os


#program to delete the duplicate files in any directory
#it is based on fact that hash value of two same file are same
# even if there names are diffrent.

#\033[xm are used for ansi colour code.
